# Security and Hardening

## Overview

Security-first development practices for Go applications. Treat every external input as hostile, every secret as sacred, and every authorization check as mandatory. Security isn't a phase — it's a constraint on every line of code that touches user data, authentication, or external systems.

## When to Use

- Building anything that accepts user input
- Implementing authentication or authorization
- Storing or transmitting sensitive data
- Integrating with external APIs or services
- Adding file uploads, webhooks, or callbacks
- Handling payment or PII data

## Process: Threat Model First

Controls bolted on without a threat model are guesses. Before hardening, spend five minutes thinking like an attacker:

1. **Map the trust boundaries.** Where does untrusted data cross into your system? HTTP requests, form fields, file uploads, webhooks, third-party APIs, message queues, and **LLM output**. Every boundary is attack surface.
2. **Name the assets.** What's worth stealing or breaking? Credentials, PII, payment data, admin actions, money movement.
3. **Run STRIDE over each boundary:**

| Threat | Ask | Typical mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **S**poofing | Can someone impersonate a user/service? | Authentication, signature verification |
| **T**ampering | Can data be altered in transit or at rest? | Integrity checks, parameterized queries, HTTPS |
| **R**epudiation | Can an action be denied later? | Audit logging of security events |
| **I**nformation disclosure | Can data leak? | Encryption, field allowlists, generic errors |
| **D**enial of service | Can it be overwhelmed? | Rate limiting, input size caps, timeouts |
| **E**levation of privilege | Can a user gain rights they shouldn't? | Authorization checks, least privilege |

4. **Write abuse cases next to use cases.** For each feature, ask "how would I misuse this?" — then make that your first test.

## The Three-Tier Boundary System

### Always Do (No Exceptions)

- **Validate all external input** at the system boundary (API routes, form handlers)
- **Parameterize all database queries** — never concatenate user input into SQL
- **Encode output** to prevent XSS (use framework auto-escaping, don't bypass it)
- **Use HTTPS** for all external communication
- **Hash passwords** with bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 (never store plaintext)
- **Set security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- **Use httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies** for sessions
- **Run `go vet`** and check for vulnerabilities before every release

### Ask First (Requires Human Approval)

- Adding new authentication flows or changing auth logic
- Storing new categories of sensitive data (PII, payment info)
- Adding new external service integrations
- Changing CORS configuration
- Adding file upload handlers
- Modifying rate limiting or throttling
- Granting elevated permissions or roles

### Never Do

- **Never commit secrets** to version control (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, full credit card numbers)
- **Never trust client-side validation** as a security boundary
- **Never disable security headers** for convenience
- **Never use `exec.Command`** with user-provided data without sanitization
- **Never store sessions in client-accessible storage** (localStorage for auth tokens)
- **Never expose stack traces** or internal error details to users

## OWASP Prevention Patterns (Go)

### Injection (SQL, NoSQL, OS Command)

```go
// BAD: SQL injection via string concatenation
query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '%s'", userID)

// GOOD: Parameterized query
row := db.QueryRow("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", userID)

// GOOD: Using an ORM with parameterized input
user, err := db.User.FindUnique(userID)
```

### Broken Authentication

```go
// Password hashing
import "golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt"

const hashCost = 12
hashed, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(plaintext), hashCost)
err = bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword(hashed, []byte(plaintext))

// Session management — use secure cookie configuration
http.SetCookie(w, &http.Cookie{
    Name:     "session",
    Value:    sessionToken,
    HttpOnly: true,
    Secure:   true,
    SameSite: http.SameSiteLaxMode,
    MaxAge:   86400,
})
```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

```go
// BAD: Rendering user input as raw HTML
w.Write([]byte(userInput))

// GOOD: Use html/template auto-escaping
tmpl.Execute(w, data) // template auto-escapes by default

// GOOD: Explicit escaping
import "html"
safe := html.EscapeString(userInput)
```

### Broken Access Control

```go
// Always check authorization, not just authentication
func UpdateTaskHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    task, err := taskService.FindByID(r.URL.Query().Get("id"))
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Not found", http.StatusNotFound)
        return
    }

    // Check that the authenticated user owns this resource
    if task.OwnerID != auth.UserID(r) {
        http.Error(w, "Forbidden", http.StatusForbidden)
        return
    }

    // Proceed with update
}
```

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

```go
// BAD: fetch whatever the user gives you
resp, err := http.Get(r.FormValue("url"))

// GOOD: allowlist scheme + host, reject private IPs
import "net/url"

var allowedHosts = map[string]bool{"hooks.example.com": true}

func assertSafeURL(raw string) (*url.URL, error) {
    parsed, err := url.Parse(raw)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    if parsed.Scheme != "https" {
        return nil, errors.New("https only")
    }
    if !allowedHosts[parsed.Hostname()] {
        return nil, errors.New("host not allowed")
    }
    // Additional: resolve DNS and check for private/reserved IPs
    return parsed, nil
}
```

## Input Validation Patterns

### Validation at Boundaries

```go
// Validate incoming data before processing
type CreateTaskRequest struct {
    Title       string `json:"title" validate:"required,min=1,max=200"`
    Description string `json:"description" validate:"max=2000"`
    Priority    string `json:"priority" validate:"required,oneof=low medium high"`
}

func CreateTaskHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var req CreateTaskRequest
    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Invalid JSON", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    if err := validate.Struct(req); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Validation failed", http.StatusUnprocessableEntity)
        return
    }
    // Process validated data
}
```

### File Upload Safety

```go
// Restrict file types and sizes
var allowedTypes = map[string]bool{
    "image/jpeg": true,
    "image/png":  true,
    "image/webp": true,
}
const maxSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024 // 5MB

func ValidateUpload(file io.Reader, header *multipart.FileHeader) error {
    if !allowedTypes[header.Header.Get("Content-Type")] {
        return errors.New("file type not allowed")
    }
    if header.Size > maxSize {
        return errors.New("file too large (max 5MB)")
    }
    return nil
}
```

## Triaging Dependency Vulnerabilities

```
Vulnerability reported in a dependency:
|-- Severity: critical or high
|   |-- Is the vulnerable code reachable in your app?
|   |   |-- YES --> Fix immediately (update, patch, or replace)
|   |   |-- NO (dev-only dep, unused code path) --> Fix soon, not a blocker
|   |-- Is a fix available?
|       |-- YES --> Update to the patched version
|       |-- NO --> Check for workarounds, consider replacing the dependency
|-- Severity: moderate
|   |-- Reachable in production? --> Fix in the next release cycle
|   |-- Dev-only? --> Fix when convenient
|-- Severity: low
    --> Track and fix during regular dependency updates
```

**Key questions:**
- Is the vulnerable function actually called in your code path?
- Is the dependency a runtime dependency or dev-only?
- Is the vulnerability exploitable given your deployment context?

### Supply-Chain Hygiene

- **Commit the lockfile** and install with `go mod vendor` or pin versions in CI — reproducible builds, no silent version drift.
- **Review new dependencies before adding them** — maintenance, download counts, and whether they truly earn their place.
- **Be wary of `init()` functions** in unfamiliar packages — they run arbitrary code at import time.
- **Watch for typosquats** — similar package names that inject malicious code.

## Rate Limiting

```go
import "golang.org/x/time/rate"

// General API rate limiter
var apiLimiter = rate.NewLimiter(rate.Every(time.Second/10), 20) // 10 req/s, burst 20

func RateLimitMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        if !apiLimiter.Allow() {
            http.Error(w, "Rate limited", http.StatusTooManyRequests)
            return
        }
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}
```

## Secrets Management

```
.env files:
  +-- .env.example  -> Committed (template with placeholder values)
  +-- .env          -> NOT committed (contains real secrets)
  +-- .env.local    -> NOT committed (local overrides)

.gitignore must include:
  .env
  .env.local
  .env.*.local
  *.pem
  *.key
```

**Always check before committing:**
```bash
# Check for accidentally staged secrets
git diff --cached | grep -i "password\|secret\|api_key\|token"
```

**If a secret is ever committed, rotate it.** Deleting the line or rewriting history is not enough — assume it's compromised the moment it reaches a remote.

## Securing AI / LLM Features

If your app calls an LLM, it inherits a new attack surface:

- **Treat all model output as untrusted input.** Never pass LLM output straight into `exec.Command`, a database query, or `template.HTML`.
- **Assume prompts can be hijacked.** The system prompt is not a security boundary; enforce permissions in code, not in the prompt.
- **Keep secrets and other users' data out of prompts.** Anything in the context can be echoed back.
- **Constrain tool and agent permissions.** Scope tools to the minimum, require confirmation for destructive actions.
- **Bound consumption.** Cap tokens, request rate, and loop depth.

```go
// BAD: trusting model output as a command
cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", llmOutput)
cmd.Run()

// GOOD: model output is data, validate before use
var intent Action
if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(llmOutput), &intent); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("unexpected model output: %w", err)
}
if err := validateAction(intent); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("invalid action: %w", err)
}
runAllowlistedAction(intent)
```

## Security Review Checklist

```markdown
### Authentication
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 (cost >= 12)
- [ ] Session tokens are httpOnly, secure, sameSite
- [ ] Login has rate limiting
- [ ] Password reset tokens expire

### Authorization
- [ ] Every endpoint checks user permissions
- [ ] Users can only access their own resources
- [ ] Admin actions require admin role verification

### Input
- [ ] All user input validated at the boundary
- [ ] SQL queries are parameterized
- [ ] HTML output is encoded/escaped
- [ ] Server-side URL fetches are allowlisted (no SSRF)

### Data
- [ ] No secrets in code or version control
- [ ] Sensitive fields excluded from API responses
- [ ] PII encrypted at rest (if applicable)

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] CORS restricted to known origins
- [ ] Dependencies audited for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internals

### AI / LLM (if used)
- [ ] Model output treated as untrusted (no exec/SQL/innerHTML)
- [ ] Secrets and other users' data kept out of prompts
- [ ] Tool/agent permissions scoped; destructive actions require confirmation
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This is an internal tool, security doesn't matter" | Internal tools get compromised. Attackers target the weakest link. |
| "We'll add security later" | Security retrofitting is 10x harder than building it in. Add it now. |
| "No one would try to exploit this" | Automated scanners will find it. Security by obscurity is not security. |
| "The framework handles security" | Frameworks provide tools, not guarantees. You still need to use them correctly. |
| "It's just a prototype" | Prototypes become production. Security habits from day one. |
| "Threat modeling is overkill here" | Five minutes of "how would I attack this?" prevents the design flaws no control can patch later. |
| "It's just LLM output, it's only text" | That "text" can be a SQL statement, a script tag, or a shell command. Treat it like any untrusted input. |

## Red Flags

- User input passed directly to database queries, shell commands, or HTML rendering
- Secrets in source code or commit history
- API endpoints without authentication or authorization checks
- Missing CORS configuration or wildcard (`*`) origins
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Stack traces or internal errors exposed to users
- Dependencies with known critical vulnerabilities
- Server fetches user-supplied URLs without an allowlist (SSRF)
- LLM/model output passed into a query, the DOM, a shell, or `exec.Command`
- Secrets, PII, or the full system prompt placed inside an LLM context window

## Verification

After implementing security-relevant code:

- [ ] No secrets in source code or git history
- [ ] All user input validated at system boundaries
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checked on every protected endpoint
- [ ] Security headers present in response
- [ ] Error responses don't expose internal details
- [ ] Rate limiting active on auth endpoints
- [ ] Server-side URL fetches validated against an allowlist (no SSRF)
- [ ] LLM/model output validated and encoded before use (if AI features present)
