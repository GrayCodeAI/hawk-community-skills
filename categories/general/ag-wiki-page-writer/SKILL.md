### Mermaid Diagrams
- **Minimum 2 per page**
- Use `autonumber` in all `sequenceDiagram` blocks
- Choose appropriate types: `graph`, `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`, `erDiagram`, `flowchart`
- **Dark-mode colors (MANDATORY)**: node fills `#2d333b`, borders `#6d5dfc`, text `#e6edf3`
- Subgraph backgrounds: `#161b22`, borders `#30363d`, lines `#8b949e`
- If using inline `style`, use dark fills with `,color:#e6edf3`
- Do NOT use `<br/>` (use `<br>` or line breaks)

### Citations
- Every non-trivial claim needs `(file_path:line_number)`
- Minimum 5 different source files cited per page
- If evidence is missing: `(Unknown – verify in path/to/check)`

### Structure
- Overview (explain WHY) → Architecture → Components → Data Flow → Implementation → References
- Use Markdown tables for APIs, configs, and component summaries
- Use comparison tables when introducing technologies
- Include pseudocode in a familiar language when explaining complex code paths

### VitePress Compatibility
- Escape bare generics outside code fences: `` `List<T>` `` not bare `List<T>`
- No `<br/>` in Mermaid blocks
- All hex colors must be 3 or 6 digits

### When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
