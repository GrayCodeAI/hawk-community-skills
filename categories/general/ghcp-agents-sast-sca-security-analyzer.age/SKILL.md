## Self-Reflection Quality Gate

> **Skill Reference**: See [audit-integrity → self-reflection-quality-gate](../skills/audit-integrity/references/self-reflection-quality-gate.md) for the shared 1–10 scoring rubric (≥8 threshold, max 2 rework iterations).

**SAST/SCA-specific quality gate categories** (extend the base categories from the skill):
- **Completeness**: Were all SAST flaw categories and SCA ecosystems evaluated?
- **Accuracy**: Are SAST findings backed by concrete taint traces and SCA findings by verified CVE IDs?
- **Actionability**: Does every Very High/High finding have a specific remediation (code fix or version upgrade)?
- **Consistency**: Are severity ratings, CWE mappings, and policy verdicts internally consistent?
- **Coverage**: Were all entry points taint-traced and all dependency manifests audited?
