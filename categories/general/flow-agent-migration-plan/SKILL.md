## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Agent Activation
- Agents are activated by pattern matching in user messages
- Higher priority patterns take precedence
- Multiple agents can be activated for complex tasks

### 2. Tool Restrictions
- Each agent has specific allowed and restricted tools
- Restrictions ensure agents stay within their domain
- Critical operations require specialized agents

### 3. Inter-Agent Communication
- Agents communicate through shared memory
- Task orchestrator coordinates multi-agent workflows
- Results are aggregated by coordinator agents

### 4. Migration Steps
1. Create `.claude$agents/` directory structure
2. Convert each command to agent definition format
3. Update activation patterns for natural language
4. Test agent interactions and handoffs
5. Implement gradual rollout with fallbacks

### 5. Backwards Compatibility
- Keep command files during transition
- Map command invocations to agent activations
- Provide migration warnings for deprecated commands

## Monitoring Migration Success

### Key Metrics
- Agent activation accuracy
- Task completion rates
- Inter-agent coordination efficiency
- User satisfaction scores
- Performance improvements

### Validation Criteria
- All commands have equivalent agents
- No functionality loss during migration
- Improved natural language understanding
- Better task decomposition and parallelization
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
