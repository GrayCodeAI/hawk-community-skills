## Summary

**Configuration Strategy**:
1. Start with `get_node` (standard detail is default)
2. Configure required fields for operation
3. Validate configuration
4. Search properties if stuck
5. Iterate until valid (avg 2-3 cycles)
6. Deploy with confidence

**Key Principles**:
- **Operation-aware**: Different operations = different requirements
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start minimal, add as needed
- **Dependency-aware**: Understand field visibility rules
- **Validation-driven**: Let validation guide configuration

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
