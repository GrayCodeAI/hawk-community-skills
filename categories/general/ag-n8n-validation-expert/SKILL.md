## Summary

**Key Points**:
1. **Validation is iterative** (avg 2-3 cycles, 23s + 58s)
2. **Errors must be fixed**, warnings are optional
3. **Auto-sanitization** fixes operator structures automatically
4. **Use runtime profile** for balanced validation
5. **False positives exist** - learn to recognize them
6. **Read error messages** - they contain fix guidance

**Validation Process**:
1. Validate → Read errors → Fix → Validate again
2. Repeat until valid (usually 2-3 iterations)
3. Review warnings and decide if acceptable
4. Deploy with confidence

## Limitations

- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
