# Introduction

[A short concise introduction to the specification and the goal it is intended to achieve.]

## 1. Purpose & Scope

[Provide a clear, concise description of the specification's purpose and the scope of its application. State the intended audience and any assumptions.]

## 2. Definitions

[List and define all acronyms, abbreviations, and domain-specific terms used in this specification.]

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

[Explicitly list all requirements, constraints, rules, and guidelines. Use bullet points or tables for clarity.]

- **REQ-001**: Requirement 1
- **SEC-001**: Security Requirement 1
- **[3 LETTERS]-001**: Other Requirement 1
- **CON-001**: Constraint 1
- **GUD-001**: Guideline 1
- **PAT-001**: Pattern to follow 1

## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

[Describe the interfaces, APIs, data contracts, or integration points. Use tables or code blocks for schemas and examples.]

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

[Define clear, testable acceptance criteria for each requirement using Given-When-Then format where appropriate.]

- **AC-001**: Given [context], When [action], Then [expected outcome]
- **AC-002**: The system shall [specific behavior] when [condition]
- **AC-003**: [Additional acceptance criteria as needed]

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

[Define the testing approach, frameworks, and automation requirements.]

- **Test Levels**: Unit, Integration, End-to-End
- **Frameworks**: MSTest, FluentAssertions, Moq (for .NET applications)
- **Test Data Management**: [approach for test data creation and cleanup]
- **CI/CD Integration**: [automated testing in GitHub Actions pipelines]
- **Coverage Requirements**: [minimum code coverage thresholds]
- **Performance Testing**: [approach for load and performance testing]

## 7. Rationale & Context

[Explain the reasoning behind the requirements, constraints, and guidelines. Provide context for design decisions.]

## 8. Dependencies & External Integrations

[Define the external systems, services, and architectural dependencies required for this specification. Focus on **what** is needed rather than **how** it's implemented. Avoid specific package or library versions unless they represent architectural constraints.]

### External Systems
- **EXT-001**: [External system name] - [Purpose and integration type]

### Third-Party Services
- **SVC-001**: [Service name] - [Required capabilities and SLA requirements]

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **INF-001**: [Infrastructure component] - [Requirements and constraints]

### Data Dependencies
- **DAT-001**: [External data source] - [Format, frequency, and access requirements]

### Technology Platform Dependencies
- **PLT-001**: [Platform/runtime requirement] - [Version constraints and rationale]

### Compliance Dependencies
- **COM-001**: [Regulatory or compliance requirement] - [Impact on implementation]

**Note**: This section should focus on architectural and business dependencies, not specific package implementations. For example, specify "OAuth 2.0 authentication library" rather than "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer v6.0.1".

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

```code
// Code snippet or data example demonstrating the correct application of the guidelines, including edge cases
```

## 10. Validation Criteria

[List the criteria or tests that must be satisfied for compliance with this specification.]
