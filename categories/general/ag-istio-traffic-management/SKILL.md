# Consistent hashing for sticky sessions
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: sticky-sessions
spec:
  host: my-service
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      consistentHash:
        httpHeaderName: x-user-id
        # or: httpCookie, useSourceIp, httpQueryParameterName
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Start simple** - Add complexity incrementally
- **Use subsets** - Version your services clearly
- **Set timeouts** - Always configure reasonable timeouts
- **Enable retries** - But with backoff and limits
- **Monitor** - Use Kiali and Jaeger for visibility

### Don'ts
- **Don't over-retry** - Can cause cascading failures
- **Don't ignore outlier detection** - Enable circuit breakers
- **Don't mirror to production** - Mirror to test environments
- **Don't skip canary** - Test with small traffic percentage first

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check VirtualService configuration
istioctl analyze

# View effective routes
istioctl proxy-config routes deploy/my-app -o json

# Check endpoint discovery
istioctl proxy-config endpoints deploy/my-app

# Debug traffic
istioctl proxy-config log deploy/my-app --level debug
```

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
