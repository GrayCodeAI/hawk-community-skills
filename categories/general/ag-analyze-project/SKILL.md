## Final Output Standard

The workflow must produce:
1. metrics summary
2. root-cause diagnosis
3. prompt-sufficiency assessment
4. subsystem/friction map
5. severity triage and prioritization
6. evidence-backed recommendations
7. non-obvious findings

Prefer explicit uncertainty over fake precision.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
