description: Curate Claude Code's auto-memory into durable project knowledge. Analyze
  MEMORY.md for patterns, promote proven learnings to CLAUDE.md and .claude/rules/,

- Use supertest for API endpoint testing
- Mock external services with msw
- Always test error responses, not just happy paths
```

This loads only when Claude works with API test files — zero overhead otherwise.

## Agents

### memory-analyst
Analyzes MEMORY.md and topic files to identify:
- Entries that recur across sessions (promotion candidates)
- Stale entries referencing deleted files or old patterns
- Related entries that should be consolidated
- Gaps between what MEMORY.md knows and what CLAUDE.md enforces

### skill-extractor
Takes a proven pattern and generates a complete skill:
- SKILL.md with proper frontmatter
- Reference documentation
- Examples and edge cases
- Ready for `/plugin install` or `clawhub publish`

## Hooks

### error-capture (PostToolUse → Bash)
Monitors command output for errors. When detected, appends a structured entry to auto-memory with:
- The command that failed
- Error output (truncated)
- Timestamp and context
- Suggested category

**Token overhead:** Zero on success. ~30 tokens only when an error is detected.
