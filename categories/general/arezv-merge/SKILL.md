## Merge Summary

- **Session**: {session-id}
- **Winner**: {winner}
- **Merged into**: {base_branch}
- **Archived**: {loser-1}, {loser-2}, ...
- **Worktrees cleaned**: {count}
```

### 6. Update State

```bash
python {skill_path}/scripts/session_manager.py --update {session-id} --state merged
```

## Safety

- **Confirm with user** before merging — show the diff summary first
- **Never force-push** — merge is always `--no-ff` for clear history
- **Archive, don't delete** — losing agents' commits are preserved via tags
- **Clean worktrees** — don't leave orphan directories on disk

## After Merge

Tell the user:
- Winner merged into `{base_branch}`
- Losers archived with tags `hub/archive/{session-id}/agent-{N}`
- Worktrees cleaned up
- Session state: `merged`
