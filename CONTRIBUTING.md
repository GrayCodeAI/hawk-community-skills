## SKILL.md Format

Every skill requires a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter must include all required fields from the schema:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: "Brief description of what this skill does"
domain: coding
tags: [my-category, technology]
version: "1.0.0"
license: MIT
author: your-github-username
---

# Skill Title

Instructions that hawk follows when this skill is active...
```

For the complete frontmatter schema, see [`manifest-schema.toml`](manifest-schema.toml).

### Frontmatter Fields

All fields must be present in the YAML frontmatter block:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | kebab-case identifier (2-80 chars). Must match directory name. |
| `description` | Yes | One-sentence summary (max 280 chars, shown in skill catalogue) |
| `domain` | Yes | Primary domain: `coding`, `cybersecurity`, `data-science`, `devops`, `documentation`, `research`, `testing`, or `other` |
| `version` | Yes | Semantic version string (e.g., `"1.0"`, `"2.3.1"`) |
| `license` | Yes | OSI-approved license: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, GPL-3.0, or CC0-1.0 |
| `author` | Yes | GitHub username or real name |
| `tags` | Yes | 1-12 searchable tags, lowercase kebab-case |
| `subdomain` | No | Finer-grained category (e.g., `cloud-security`, `ai-ml`) |
| `phase` | No | Pipeline phase: `localize`, `repair`, `validate`, `review`, `planning`, or `any` |
| `tools_required` | No | Tools the skill depends on (e.g., `[bash]`, `[read, edit]`) |
| `min_model` | No | Minimum capable model tier: `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, or `any` |

### SKILL.md Body Format

Every `SKILL.md` follows this structure:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: "Brief description..."
domain: coding
version: "1.0"
license: MIT
author: your-github-username
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---

# Skill Title

## Overview
What this skill does and when to use it.

## Prerequisites
Tools, knowledge, or setup required before using this skill.

## Instructions
Step-by-step guidance with code examples. Use clear section headers.

## References
Links to documentation, tools, or related skills.

## Verification
How to verify the skill works correctly (tests, checklists, etc.).
```

### Content Guidelines

- **Be concise** — Focus on practical patterns and examples
- **Use code blocks** — Show real, working code with language identifiers
- **Structure clearly** — Use headers for scanability (`## Overview`, `## Prerequisites`, `## Instructions`, `## References`)
- **Stay current** — Reference latest stable versions
- **Be opinionated** — Share best practices, not just options
- **One focus per skill** — Each skill should cover a single technology or pattern
- **Include a Verification section** — Helps ensure the skill produces consistent, testable results

## Registry Entry

Add your skill to `registry.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "my-skill-name",
  "name": "my-skill-name",
  "description": "Brief description",
  "category": "frameworks",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
  "languages": ["typescript"],
  "frameworks": ["react"],
  "isFeatured": false,
  "isCurated": false,
  "rating": 0,
  "downloadCount": 0,
  "directory": "my-skill-name",
  "files": ["SKILL.md"],
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "author": "your-github-username"
}
```

### Registry Entry

`registry.json` is auto-generated from all `SKILL.md` frontmatter files. When you add a skill, run `python tools/update_registry.py` to regenerate it. The registry is consumed by the hawk client for skill discovery and installation.

The `category` field in `registry.json` is derived from the `domain` field in frontmatter. Valid values are: `coding`, `cybersecurity`, `data-science`, `devops`, `documentation`, `research`, `testing`, or `other`.

### Multi-File Skills

Skills can include additional files beyond `SKILL.md`:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required
├── templates/            # Optional: templates referenced by the skill
├── examples/             # Optional: usage examples
└── scripts/              # Optional: shell scripts
```

Update the `files` array in your registry entry when adding extra files:
```json
"files": ["SKILL.md", "templates/component.tsx", "templates/test.tsx"]
```
